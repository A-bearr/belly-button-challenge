# Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge
Module 14 challenge 

This project visualizes the bacterial data of different test subjects' belly buttons. The dashboard includes interactive charts displaying OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) and metadata for each test subject.

## Features

- A **Bar Chart** of the top 10 OTUs for a given test subject.
- A **Bubble Chart** that shows all OTUs found in a sample, with varying sizes for each OTU.
- A **Demographic Info Panel** that displays metadata for each test subject.
- A dropdown menu to select a test subject and update the charts dynamically.

## Deployment

Deployed on GitHub Pages. You can access the dashboard here:

Any code I did not generate myself was from the Xpert learning assistant within this designated course and modified by myself to create an applicable and working code. Xpert learning assistant is this course's AI tool.
